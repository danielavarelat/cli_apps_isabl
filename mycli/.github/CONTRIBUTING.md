## Development

Follow these steps for local development:

1. Bet you've read the [Zen Of Python].

1. Clone your mycli locally:

        git clone git@github.com:isabl-io/mycli.git

1. Create a branch for local development:

        git pull
        git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

    Now you can make your changes locally.

1. Create a test in:

        mycli/tests

1. Run [pytest] with [coverage], [pylint] and [pydocstyle] using Docker Compose:

        bash ./tests/test-with-compose.sh

    If you have a development Isabl API instance running, simply use [pytest]:

        py.test tests --cov=mycli

    To just check that your changes pass [pylint] and [pydocstyle] requirements:

        pylint --rcfile=.pylintrc mycli
        pydocstyle --config=.pydocstylerc mycli

1. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub (see our [`.gitmessage`] template):

        git add .
        git config commit.template .gitmessage
        git commit -m ":emoji-name: your short and nice description"
        git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

    `emoji-name` should be one of the following:

    | emoji | name                 | type of change              |
    | ----- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
    | üöÄ    | `:rocket:`           | new feature                 |
    | üêõ    | `:bug:`              | bug fix                     |
    | üìù    | `:memo:`             | changes to documentation    |
    | üé®    | `:art:`              | formatting  no code change  |
    | üîß    | `:wrench:`           | refactoring production code |
    | ‚úÖ     | `:white_check_mark:` | adding/editing test logic   |
    | üëï    | `:shirt:`            | no production code change   |
    | üíé    | `:gem:`              | bump to new version         |

    If you are suggesting a new version make sure you are following the [semantic versioning] guidelines and then update the [`VERSION`] file:

        git add mycli/VERSION
        git commit -m ":gem: bump to version 0.1.0"
